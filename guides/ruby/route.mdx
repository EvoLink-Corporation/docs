### HR Management Software

Ruby Bus Services is proudly a Early Access Member of [Series](https://series.hr), a HR Management Software that connects Discord and Roblox. We currently do not have access to the Staff Managemet Suite, as that will roll out in phases. Currently, we use Series for the following features: Webhooks, Mail (@evolinkrblx.com), Abuse Protection, and Reputation. All users who have a email which is all staff, will have access to the Staff Documents. **Do not leak this section named "Guides" **within this Documentation Website to anybody who is not a staff member, or displicinary action will be taken.
