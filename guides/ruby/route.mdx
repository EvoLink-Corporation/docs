### HR Management Software

Ruby Bus Services is proudly a Early Access Member of [Series](https://series.hr), a HR Management Software that connects Discord and Roblox. We currently do not have access to the Staff Managemet Suite, as that will roll out in phases. Currently, we use Series for the following features: Webhooks, Mail (@evolinkrblx.com), Abuse Protection, and Reputation. Currently, we \*\*do not use \*\*Series for Activity Tracking, until the Staff Management Suite is semi-released.
