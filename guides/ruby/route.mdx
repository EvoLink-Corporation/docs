## Announcements

This contains the announcements you are required to make \*\*atleast 30 \*\*minutes before a route is being hosted.

## Roblox Group (Guilded Shout)

You should have access to Guilded. If you \*\*do not \*\*have access to guilded, please ask your _Department Director_ for access.

## Discord Server Message

We use the bot "RBS Assistant" for our routes. You are required to have the "Staff" role to execute this command. It is banned in all channels except #route-notify. If you try to use this command in other channels, it will \*\*not \*\*work.

Run the command `/route` in #route-notify. It will require you to add a user when you are running the command. Put yourself or whoever is hosting this route. Do \*\*not \*\*put your Co-Host here. Once run, you will be shown a form with a title of "Route Hosting". Please add the type of route in the first field which could include a Field Trip, just "Route" or "Special Route". \*\*Do NOT abbreviate this as it will show up in the embed. \*\*The second field will make you add the time. Please use Hammertime. You should add just the time such as _11:00 AM_ with Hammertime, and then put how many minutes using Hammertime in parentheses. You finished result should look like this (example) _11:00 AM (in 30 minutes)_. This is only an example, and it will not show these exact times. Then, send the form and a message will be posted. \*\*You are required to post \*\*"Start Joining", "Cancelled" or anything else. Always ping @Route Notification when you are posting these announcements; the bot will ping when you do the command so you should \*\*not \*\*do that then. You have officially posted your route\!

## Start-Up

<Note>
  You should only run the commands below \*\*12 minutes before \*\*your scheduled route time.
